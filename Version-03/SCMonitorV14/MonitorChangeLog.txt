Southern Cross Monitor Version 1.2
----------------------------------

Changes to Southern Cross Monitor Version 1.1   February, 1993.

1. When the Function Key is pressed twice, the routine jumps to the
address loaded at FUNJMP. It is set to CANCEL in the Fn routine and is
reloaded after Reset.

2. The table in the Function routine is now accessed by pointer FUNTBL
this will allow users to change the Function key assignments. It is set to
FUNLST (the Function key table) and is reloaded after Reset.

3. RAMCHK has been renamed as DALLAS as it is used in the Dallas
Smartwatch routines.

4. Read and write Smartwatch have had more explanation added to the
subroutine headers.

5. The Default serial BAUD rate is now 4800 Baud, which is reloaded after
Reset.

6. IO7 has been added as it is now used for the Single Stepper Hardware.

7. CALMDE has been added to the Smartwatch registers, if bit 7 is high the
calendar (Fn F) shows the date in MM/DD/YY mode, if bit 7 is low it is
shown in DD/MM/YY. This allows the setting of the date in the Smartwatch
to the country preference.

8. DELAYR has been renamed DELONE.

9. The Relay test program is now Fn D and not Fn 7.

10. Fn 7 is used to toggle the hardware single stepper if attached.It
displays a T in the rightmost Data display briefly to indicate the Trace
toggle.

11. All of the Relay code has been moved above to Fn D.
 (All the code for each function key is now in order).

12. Corrected spelling of 'Separate'

July, 1993.  Version 1.21
-------------------------

A buyer rang to point out that the relay test did not test all relays. We
found that a 05H instead of 55H at 0B7D in the Monitor was to blame. The
test was missing relay positions D4 and D6.

February 2003. Version 1.3  (This version was UNRELEASED)
--------------------------

The 74C923 code was removed and replaced with software scanned keyboard code.

1. Added SYSFLG at 3FB3H 'System Flags' 
Bit 1 is used to indicate the type of keyboard.
  
Bit 1 = 1 Software scanned keyboard.
Bit 1 = 0 Hardware scanned keyboard.

Initialization routine checks if DA is high ( software scanned keyboard
has DA tied high to allow for detection) and sets Bit 1 accordingly.

2. Added SCANKEY routine to scan keyboard, replaced all
 
IN      A,(KEYBUF) with 

with

CALL    SCANKEY

except for the increment/ decrement key handling which required some additional mods.
Added SCANKEY to system call jump table.

March 2021 Version 1.4
----------------------

1. Cleared SYSFLG on Reset and changed the keyboard flag to bit 0.

2. The receive INTEL hex routine did not work in the 1.3 version.
   The RXDATA routine had a cancel feature allowing a keypress to break out of the 'waiting for serial character' loop. 
   The SCANKEY routine takes a lot longer than IN  A,(KEYBUF) so the receive INTEL hex routine was now not fast enough to process incoming bytes.
   The cancel functionality was removed from the RXDATA routine, the receive INTEL hex routine now just returns to the monitor if the file download was
   successful.
   
3. The Receive INTEL Hex routine (INTELH) was made stand alone and added to the system call jump table so it could be called from outside the monitor.
