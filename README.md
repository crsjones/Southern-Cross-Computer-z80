# Southern Cross Computer

I developed the Z80 Southern Cross Computer for Hong Kong based Kitsrus in 1992/93.
The kit was based on the TEC-1 Computer that was designed by John Hardy and Ken Stone
in 1983 and appeared in Australia's Talking Electronics Magazine Issue 10. 
The music and music routines were copied from the TEC-1's original monitor MON-1.

The computer also appeared in Silicon Chip Magazine in the August 1993 edition.
