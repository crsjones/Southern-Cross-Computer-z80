# Southern Cross Computer

I developed the Z80 Southern Cross Computer for Hong Kong based Kitsrus in 1992/93.
The kit was based on the TEC-1 Computer that was designed by John Hardy and Ken Stone
in 1983 and appeared in Australia's Talking Electronics Magazine Issue 10 March 1983.

Kitsrus distributed the kit into the US and the UK and was sold online from Hong Kong.

The Southern Cross Computer appeared in Australia's Silicon Chip Magazine in the August 1993 edition.
A follow up article appeared in Silicon Chip in December 1993 describing the 8x8 LED Matrix and 8 Channel Relay add-on board.

Since 2021 I have been a member of the Facebook TEC-1 Z80 Computer Group and have developed several add-on boards for the 
Southern Cross Computer along with a new version of the TEC-1 computer, the TEC-1F.
