# Southern Cross Computer

I developed the Z80 Southern Cross Computer for Hong Kong based Kitsrus in 1992/93.
The kit was based on the TEC-1 Computer that was designed by John Hardy and Ken Stone
in 1983 and appeared in Australia's Talking Electronics Magazine Issue 10. 

The Southern Cross Computer appeared in Australia's Silicon Chip Magazine in the August 1993 edition.
I also designed an 8x8 LED Matrix and an 8 Channel Relay add-on board which also appeared in Silicon Chip. 

After 30 years I revisited this design and made a revision 3 Southern Cross PCB.
Also creating some new add-on cards and a new revision of the 8x8 LED Matrix. 

### SC-8x8   8 x 8 LED Matrix
The original 8 x8 LED Matrix design plus a couple of revisions.
### SC-GBCART
An add-on board that connects a Gameboy FLASH cartridge to the Southern Cross SBC.
### SC-SERIAL 
A MC6850 serial board based on the Grant Searle 'Minimum System Z80' design.
### SC-APU
An add-on card for the AM9511A  Arithmetic Processor Unit.

# Current Version

The current version of the PCB is 3.2, Gerbers are available in the 3.2 folder.

The current version of the monitor is 1.7
It can be conditionally assembled for use with the MM74C923 Keyboard encoder or 
used with a software scanned keyboard if the keyboard encoder is difficult to source.

Details on how to modify the PCB for software scanned keyboard are in the Docs folder.
