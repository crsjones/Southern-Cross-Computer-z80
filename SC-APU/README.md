### SC-APU

This add-on board was created for Stephen Justin of the TEC-1 Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/tec1z80 and
inspired by Philip Stevens' RC2014 APU https://github.com/RC2014Z80/RC2014/tree/master/Hardware/APU%20RC2014

There are two code examples, the first, SC-LLL-FP is a purely software demonstration of the "Lawrence Livermore Laboratory Floating Point Package".
I have a separate repository with more info about this code.

The second code example, AM9511A uses the APU to perform basic arithmetic operations.
To run the code on the APU you need to be using the Southern Cross Monitor 1.8 as it uses the monitor system calls.
