Known Z8T.COM Information.     

Source code filename extension must be renamed from .MAC (Or .ASM) to .Z8T

Diskette Contents     

1.  Z8T.COM   	Public Domain MSDOS Z80 Assembler, written in 8088 code.
2.  Z8T.DOC     This doc file.           

Fast assembler, known to run with V20, 8088, and 80286. 

Assembler doesn't like bit 7 being set in source code text. This is usually 
created by using Wordstar in document mode. To clear bit 7, enter W.S. in 
non-document mode, do a ^Q^Q^B at the start of the file, and wait for file 
conversion to 7 bit Ascii text. 

Likewise, it doesn't like out of step carraige returns and line feeds.
eg:- 0DH, 0AH, 0DH is not a matched pair. The last 0DH needs to be deleted.
It can be found in the non-document mode by looking at the right hand marker
which should be a "<" symbol. If it is a "-" then it can be easily deleted
by doing an enter then del at that point.

Doesn't like instruction in label: field, must be tabbed across.
Doesn't like global statements.

".Z80"   Command not needed.    (Ignored) 
".PHASE" Command not supported. (Gives error) 

Two Output Files....
(1) "FILENAME.HEX" File is in Intel-HEX format.
(2) "FILENAME.PRN" File is printable output.

Assembly switches are placed after a space on the command line.

Eg:-  Z8T FILENAME C

C Outputs FILENAME.PRN to console
L Suppresses FILENAME.HEX output
N Produces printer unformatted FILENAME.PRN file
O Creats a very short FILENAME.PRN file used for error logging.
P Outputs FILENAME.PRN to printer
X Outputs symbol table only as FILENAME.PRN
Y Outputs normal FILENAME.PRN but without symbol table

Assembly times for the same 35K source code test file....

Using M80 and L80....
10Mhz V20 in "8080" Mode      47 Seconds (.COM and .PRN output)
10Mhz V20 in "8080" Mode      33 Seconds (.COM output only)

Using Z8T FILENAME    (Full .PRN File)
4.77Mhz V20       2 Min 2 Sec             10Mhz V20      1 Min 6 Sec
8Mhz    80286     49 Seconds              12Mhz 80286    33 Seconds
16Mhz   80286     22 Seconds              25Mhz 80286    18 Seconds

Using Z8T FILENAME O  (Short .PRN Error Log File)
4.77Mhz V20       1 Min 34 Sec            10Mhz V20      50 Seconds
8Mhz    80286     37 Seconds              12Mhz 80286    22 Seconds
16Mhz   80286     16 Seconds              25Mhz 80286    10 Seconds

I can only assume that faster systems will show faster times.

Known Bugs In Current Version
-----------------------------
1. A HEX constant denoted with a leading '$' may cause a syntax error if
   its last digit is 'B' or 'D'.  Use the alternate form for HEX constants
   (Trailing 'H').
