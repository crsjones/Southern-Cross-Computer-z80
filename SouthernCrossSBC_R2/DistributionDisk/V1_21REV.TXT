Southern Cross Monitor Version 1.2
----------------------------------

Changes to Southern Cross Monitor Version 1.1   February, 1993.

1. When the Function Key is pressed twice, the routine jumps to the
address loaded at FUNJMP. It is set to CANCEL in the Fn routine and is
reloaded after Reset.

2. The table in the Function routine is now accessed by pointer FUNTBL
this will allow users to change the Function key assignments. It is set to
FUNLST (the Function key table) and is reloaded after Reset.

3. RAMCHK has been renamed as DALLAS as it is used in the Dallas
smartwatch routines.

4. Read and write Smartwatch have had more explanation added to the
subroutine headers.

5. The Default serial BAUD rate is now 4800 Baud, which is reloaded after
Reset.

6. IO7 has been added as it is now used for the Single Stepper Hardware.

7. CALMDE has been added to the Smartwatch registers, if bit 7 is high the
calendar (Fn F) shows the date in MM/DD/YY mode, if bit 7 is low it is
shown in DD/MM/YY. This allows the setting of the date in the Smartwatch
to the country preference.

8. DELAYR has been renamed DELONE.

9. The Relay test program is now Fn D and not Fn 7.

10. Fn 7 is used to toggle the harware single stepper if attached.It
displays a T in the rightmost Data display briefly to indicate the Trace
toggle.

11. All of the Relay code has been moved above Fn F, to Fn D where it
belongs. (All the code for each function key is now in order).

12. Corrected spelling of 'Separate'

July, 1993.  Version 1.21
-------------------------

A buyer rang to point out that the relay test did not test all relays. We
found that a 05H instead of 55H at 0B7D in the Monitor was to blame. The
test was missing relay positions D4 and D6.
