# Southern Cross Serial

This circuit is based on the “Minimum chip count z80 computer” design by Grant Searle and is commonly used in the RC2014 project.

Here it has been adapted for the Southern Cross Computer adding the expansion connector, I/O decoding, 
and a header for a FTDI USB to serial converter.
